user_review = [
  "Useless power. The spider-web are not sticky enough and you cannot climb on the glass of modern buildings, the stickiness is not strong enough. Plus you are not allowed to slice people with this power, the owner is not insured.",
  "Great costume. All as described, I really liked the very tight costume.",
  "I had a great time using this super power. All the girls were chasing me! the only down side is that the costume provided by the owner was to small for me.",
  "I don't understand all the hype for this super power. Is nothing special, there are to many restrictions. The only good thing was that I had the chance to fight against Thanos, like iron-man, SPOILER ALERT but without dying."

  "Superhuman strength and reflexes, enhanced senses and tracking abilities, and a special healing power that also slows your aging"
